Campus Placement Helpmate is a one stop platform to bridge the gap between students, colleges and companies.
Campus Placement Helpmate is a web application in which there will be 3 modules student login, college login, and corporate login. 

• Student will create resume and prepare for the upcoming interviews and exams. 

• College uploads placement record through the system and submitted placement records are verified. 

• Placement statistics and graph visualizations are shown to campus placement helpmate team and corporate through which they can analyse the unemployability ratio and devise the employability policies. 

• Campus Placement Helpmate Team / Corporate can search the placement records by state, program, stream, year, gender, college, level, etc. 

• Corporate can access the unemployability data and send job opportunities to college/students based on the placement stats of the college. 

• College submits the reasons of unemployability which are then analysed by campus placement helpmate team, that acts as a key factor to frame new employment policies.

• In this project Pan + Aadhar based tracking will be done of each candidate to ensure the security of information.

If you want to locally run the prototype of campus placement helpmate you need to login at AdobeXD and then you can test the prototype.
